  <p>
  Data management is the practice of collecting, keeping, and using data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.
  Statistics is there for a process, where we are collecting data, summarizing data, and interpreting data.
  
  Exploratory data analysis is what you use to make sense of the data.
  Basically, exploratory data analysis(EDA) consists of organizing and summarizing raw data, looking for important feature  s and patterns in the data, looking for any     striking deviations from those patterns, and interpreting your findings in the context of the problem or research question.

  There are various techniques in Data Management : 
  1) Database Development
  2) Data pre-prosessing
  3) Data Cleaning
  4) Data integration
  5) Metadata

  Data and information visualization is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information.
  It is a way to represent information graphically, highlighting patterns and trends in data and helping the reader to achieve quick insights.
  
  Three main goal of Data Visualization is:
  1) To explore
  2) To monitor
  3) To Explain
